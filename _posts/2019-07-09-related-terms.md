The terms X, Y and W are closely related to one another.

W is the name of a modern day country that was known until the 1930s as V, although the people of W themselves did not come up with the name V.

W is derived ultimately from Y.

Y refers to a type of people that lived in a specific region not far from modern day W, and is derived from the Sanskrit word X.

X is an adjective -- that the Y people (and the people of V or W) are presumed to have been blessed with -- variously meaning noble, wealthy, and its spread over time to parts of south and south east Asia has now shaped its meaning to simply mean 'respectable'.

Provide specific terms X, Y, W and V.
