In 1819 a British army officer named Capt. John Smith was hunting a tiger in the jungle, when the tiger led him to a remote location in the forest and he accidentally stumbled upon X. Historical accounts by Chinese travelers and writings from Akbar’s time mention X, but information about X and it’s location was subsequently lost, and X was generally unknown to the world when Capt. Smith discovered it by chance.

X is now a UNESCO world heritage site. The first image below shows an aerial view of X from the present day. The second image is of a famous painting Y found at X. The 3rd image is also a painting at X, and has been used to form the logo of an organization W. What are X and W. What does the painting Y depict? Roughly how old is X?
