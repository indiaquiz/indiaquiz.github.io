Towards the end of the movie Seven, starring Brad Pitt and Morgan freeman, a box is opened by Brad Pitt, to reveal, to his horror, the decapitated head of Gweneth Paltrow.

A similar incident has occurred in a real historical event in India. X's decapitated head was sent in a box as a parcel to Y, who was eating when the box was opened. Y is said to have been so disturbed on seeing X's head that Y fainted and afterwards went into a period of declining health, leading to Y's death.

X wrote translations of Hindu scriptures to better understand the Hindu religion and its philosophy. In one of X's writings, X writes that Lord Ram came to X in a dream. This invited the irk of Z, who is responsible for chopping X's head and sending it to Y.

Identify X, Y and Z
