In a 1976 study on genetic testing of the Sinhalese population in Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese were found to be genetically closest to the East Indian population of Bengal and surrounding areas. More recent studies have also shown that genetic distance of Sinhalese is smallest with the Bengali.

This finding offers affirmation for the following legend that ultimately suggests an etymology of the word Sinhalese:
The historical chronicles the Buddhist texts Mahavamsa and Dipavamsa describe a Vanga prince named Vijaya from East India as an early settler in Sri Lanka and the progenitor of the Sinhalese. In these chronicles, Vijay's grandfather is said to have been an X. X features in the East Indian region via two separate deities Y and Z, both prominent in the region. Z is half human and half X.

Identify X, Y and Z.
