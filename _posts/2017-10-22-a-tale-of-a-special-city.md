Some say that the modern day city X was strategically named by the king Y in order to turn myth into reality so he could rule from this city and over the hearts of people. Others insist that Y in fact rediscovered the ancient city X that had been abandoned.

The ancient name for the city X before Y named it so, was Z, which means heaven or "abode of the gods". This meaning is attested to in a number of Buddhist, Jain, Chinese and Greek sources. In Sanskrit X means W, and this meaning of the city's name is attested in the Atharvaveda. The Chinese monk Fa Hein visited Z, calling it 'Sha-chi', and by the time Hiuen Tsang visited it, its name had become X. Z is also the title of a poem that is famous for presenting a well known story associated with X, from V's point of view. At least two other modern day countries have cities named after X. In 2001, a 7.5 tonne stone memorial of legendary South Korean queen Heo Hwang-Ok was inaugurated in X by a South Korean delegation, after X was identified by Korean historians as the place of origin of their historical queen. Hundreds of South Korean tourists visit X every year to pay tributes to their queen.
