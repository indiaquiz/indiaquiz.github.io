On Jan 9, 2018, the supreme court of India overruled an earlier order that required citizens to practice X. On February 10, 2017, 2 Kashmiris were arrested and fined for not practicing X. The voluntary practice of X was commonplace in the 1960s but gradually declined. The central component Y involved in X traces its roots to the early 20th century although Y gained widespread use only in the middle of the century, before which it was preceded by Z. Z was superseded by Y because of objections from W.
