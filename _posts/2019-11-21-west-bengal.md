Have you ever wondered why the state of West Bengal is so called even though it is in the Eastern part of India? This is because of the event X. The event X led the person Y to write the song Z whose English translation begins as follows:

>>My golden ____, I love you.\
>>Forever your skies, your air set my heart in tune as if it were a flute\
>>O mother! the aroma of the mango orchard in the spring time drives me crazy.\
>>Ah, what a thrill!\
>>O mother! in Late Autumn time sees smiles all through mature fields of paddy.\

>>What beauty, what shades, what affection, what tenderness!\
>>What a quilt have you spread at the feet of banyan trees and along the bank of every river\
>>Oh mother mine, words from your lips are like nectar to my ears.\
>>Ah, what a thrill!\

>>If sadness, O mother! casts a gloom on your face, my eyes are filled with tears!\

Identify X, Y and Z.
