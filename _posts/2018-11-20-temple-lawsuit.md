In the year 2001, lawyers acting on behalf of a temple of X in Pushkar, Rajasthan took a case to court against a nearby temple of Y. Their argument was that, the story went that Y had 'divorced' X because X was late to an important yagya. Based on this, the lawyers demanded Z.

Who are X and Y? What outcome Z was the case demanding?
