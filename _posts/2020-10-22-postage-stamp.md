The object shown in the postage stamp is a X, located in the city Y. Y is an ancient city that was famous for its university, but the city was lost around 500 AD and then rediscovered in the mid-1800s. Identify X and Y, and all scripts on the postage stamp other than English.

The rediscovery of Y is credited to Z, who found it by noticing a discrepancy between the distance calculations prevalent at the time, and distances described by W in his diaries.

Z went on to found an organization V in 1861 that lives on to this day, doing the type of work that Z did. 

Identify X, Y, Z, W and V. Apart from English, identify all the other scripts on the postage stamp.

Some more clues: W was a traveler who wrote detailed travelogues and it was his estimate that was correct and led to Y. Z was also the first to discover seals in the Indus Valley. W and Z are both not native to the Indian subcontinent.
