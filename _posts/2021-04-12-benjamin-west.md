This famous painting made by Benjamin West in the year 1818 shows an event that proved _very_ significant to the course of India's history. X is handing a piece of paper to Y.

This question is mostly trivia (it is not possible to easily work out the answer from the clues). 
Who are X and Y?
Roughly what does the paper say?
What is the approximate date of this event?
Something about this painting is a bit strange/shady. What?
