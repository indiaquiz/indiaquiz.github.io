Around 300 BC during the reign of king X, a 12 year long famine struck the capital. To escape famine, a group of people from the capital migrated southward into Karnataka. When they returned to their capital several years later, they found that the people who had stayed back had adopted a completely new practice into their lifestyle. This practice was something very basic. This basic difference led to a division among the people into two religious groups: those who followed this new practice and those who did not.

What are the two religious groups called? What was this new practice? Who is king X?
