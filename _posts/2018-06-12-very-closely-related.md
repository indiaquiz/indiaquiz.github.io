X, Y, Z and W are four very closely related terms.

X:
The earliest known record of any member of this family is the appearance of the word X in an inscription in Iran from the 6th century BC. attributed to the Persian king Darius I in which he claims to have “added the region X to his empire”

Y:
X, expressed in ancient Persian, is believed to have been derived from the Sanskrit term Y, that referred to a prime geographic feature of the region.

Ancient Persian and Sanskrit are known to be close relatives - the 'S’ sound at the start of a word in Sanskrit would invariably be replaced by an aspirate 'H' sound in ancient Persian (therefore the Vedic drink Soma mentioned in the Rigveda became Homa in ancient Persian, etc).

Z:
Z is a type of Y, but it is so majestic and by far the prime among the seven Y's in the region that the general Sanskrit term Y was understood to refer to Z.

W:
The modern day term W, which like X also refers to a geographic region, derives directly from the term Z. However W can be considered a misnomer because the Z that it derives from is not a part of modern day W.

Provide precise terms for X, Y, Z and W

Bonus: U was furious upon hearing the name W (and for good reason) - he had instead expected V. Identify U and V.
