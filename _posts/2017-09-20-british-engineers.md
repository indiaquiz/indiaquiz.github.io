title: "British engineers worrying about ballast"

The following is an account of two British engineers from 1856, worrying about how to obtain ballast for the railway lines they had been charged with building during the British Raj (balast is gravel or coarse stone used to form the bed of a railroad track or road), and eventually finding the satisfactory material in the countryside:

John wrote:
>> “I was much exercised in my mind how we were to get ballast for the line of the railway".

They were told of an area X near the lines. Visiting X, he found it full of Z’s that seemed of excellent strength and very suitable for ballast. 
John later wrote:
>> “convinced that there was a grand quarry for the ballast I wanted, we proceeded to reduce the Z’s to ballast”.

A few months later, further north, John's brother William's section of the line ran near a place called Y, from which the Z's had already been used by villagers in the nearby village. The Z's eventually provided ballast along 93 miles (150 km) of the railroad track.

Identify X, Y and Z.
