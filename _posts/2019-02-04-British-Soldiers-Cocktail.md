The word X comes from a word in Ancient Greek which means Y. Till the the 1300s X was made exclusively from Y. A bottle of “Y X” is found in many kitchens today.

The cocktail X was invented in India during the british raj. British officers in British India were required to consume Y to guard against a disease prevalent at the time. But Y was extremely bitter, so the soldiers combined Y with sugar syrup and their ration of Z, which resulted in the creation of the cocktail X. The soldiers mixed their medical supply of X which they were required to consume to with sugar syrup to make it easier to consume. Over time this led to the invention of Y and later the cocktail Z.
