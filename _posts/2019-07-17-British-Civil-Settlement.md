X became the first civil settlement of the British in India with the status of a municipality. The name X came from the local name Y, the name of a nearby village, while Z, the present day name for X is of Telegu origin.

The second civil settlement W of the British in India came to them as a gift. In 1661, King Charles II received W as part of the dowry, when he married Princess Catherine de Braganza of Portugal. Not wanting to maintain and rule W, the king rented out W to the East India Company, only for 10 pounds in gold a year!
