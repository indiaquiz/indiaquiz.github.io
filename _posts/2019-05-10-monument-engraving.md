Atop which monument completed in 1601 can the following inscription be found: "Jesus son of Mary said: 'The world is a Bridge, pass over it, but build no houses upon it. He who hopes for a day, may hope for eternity; but the World endures but an hour. Spend it in prayer for the rest is unseen.'" The monument has a connection to Gujarat but is not located in it.
