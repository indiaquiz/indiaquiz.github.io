title: "Corruptions of Indian words"

The word X makes its first appearance on Portuguese maps at the start of the sixteenth century. It was then picked up in quick succession by the Dutch, the French, the Danes and the English. Like so many Indian words that crept into the English language, it is a corruption. The true term is in fact Y, which means "the realm of the Z". Words very similar to Y first appear in inscriptions in the great temples of Tanjore. The term Z first appears in rock inscriptions ordered by W as early as 326 BC, and continue to appear, century after century, up until 1279 AD - making the Z one of the longest ruling dynaties in all of world history.
