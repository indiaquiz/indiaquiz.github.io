Some Pakistani politicians and experts have demanded that X be "returned" to Pakistan. In 2016 Pakistani barrister, Javed Iqbal Jaffery, petitioned the Lahore High Court for the return of X, claiming that X was to Pakistan what Da Vinci's Mona Lisa was to Europe.

The X in question is currently on display at the National museum in New Delhi. One of the persons associated with its find is said to have been very surprised upon first seeing it "When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric."

The existence of X conveys two important facts about the period it is from: Y relating to technology, and Z relating to culture.

Identify X, Y and Z
