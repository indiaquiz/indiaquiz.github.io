Rudrapatnam Shyamashastri was a librarian at the Mysore Oriental Library in 1905 when he was visited by a Brahmin from Tanjore who handed him a manuscript on dried palm leaves. Shyamasashtri had never seen anything like it. He soon realized that this was an important historical manuscript and that it was more than 2000 years old. Slowly he began publishing translations of the text, bit by bit, like a modern television serial. The translated text sent an electrifying reaction worldwide and toppled the clich√©d notion that ancient Indians were mainly concerned with spirituality. It is now agreed that this text was lost around 200 BC and was rediscovered only in 1905, more than 2000 years later. The text has been said to be closely studied by a certain group of people in Pakistan.

Identify the text.
