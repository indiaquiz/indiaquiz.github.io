The autobiography of Y says the following about the place P1: "There are no good-looking people, there is no social intercourse, no receiving or paying of visits, no genius or manners. In its handicrafts there is no form or symmetry, method or quality. There are no good horses, no good dogs, no grapes, musk-melons or first-rate fruits, no ice or cold water, no good bread or food cooked in the bazaars, no hot baths, no colleges, no candles, torches or candlesticks."

The same autobiography is believed to contain the very first mention of X, which was given to Y upon victory over Z. X was not called X for at least another 200 years, and it is originally thought to have been found at P2.
