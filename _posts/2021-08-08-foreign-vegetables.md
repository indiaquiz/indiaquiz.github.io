The word X entered the English language between 1840 and 1850 from Romanian, which came from the Ottoman Turkish. X is a popular preparation in Central and South Asia, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Eastern Europe, Malta, North Africa and the Horn of Africa. X takes on a very large variety of forms, one of which is Y and another is Z. 

Y and Z are both popular in India. Y is made from a vegateable that came to India from Iran and Afghanistan. The vegetable was originally purple in color, but around 1500-1600 AD, the dutch bred a variant to honor their flag at the time, and it is this version that made its way to India, eventually ending up in Y, which was widely populuarized in the Indian subcontinent by the Mughals. 
Z is a form that originated in pre-ottoman Turkey and spread to Arabic cultures. It is made from starch, oils and sugar. It came to the Indian subcontinent via Arabic spice traders who had trade links to two different trading ports, far apart from each other. These port cities appear in the names by which Z is known.
