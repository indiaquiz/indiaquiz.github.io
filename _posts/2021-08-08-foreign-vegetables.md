The word X entered the English language between 1840 and 1850 from Romanian, which came from the Ottoman Turkish. X is a popular preparation in Central and South Asia, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Eastern Europe, Malta, North Africa and the Horn of Africa. X takes on a very large variety of forms -  Y and Z are two distinct forms popular in India. 

Y is made from a vegetable that was originally purple in color, but in the 16th century, the dutch bred a variant to honor their flag at the time, and this made its way to India via the British, eventually ending up in Y, which was widely populuarized on the subcontinent by the Mughals. The Hindi word for this vegetable derives directly from its Persian counterpart. 

Z is a form that originated in pre-ottoman Turkey and spread to Arabic cultures. It is made from starch, oils and sugar. It came to the Indian subcontinent via Arabic spice traders who had trade links to two different trading ports, far apart from each other. These port cities appear in the names by which Z is known. 

Identify X, Y, Z and the two port cities.
