On the date X, a video now known as Y was aired for the first time. The video was produced by an organization named V and the music was done by Z, who is said to have been inspired by a british movie W about running.

One shot shows a famous female athlete rounding a turn on a track with a backdrop of lush green trees and deer darting around. Another shot shows a male sportsman T with his little daughter - now an actress - running beside him.

The music takes a climactic twist at the end - this created controversy during the production process - ultimately U watched two versions of the video, one with and another without the climactic twist and okayed the climactic one.

What are X, Y, Z, W, V, U and T.
