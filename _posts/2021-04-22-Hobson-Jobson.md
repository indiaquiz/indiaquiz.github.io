Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive is a historical dictionary of Anglo-Indian words and terms from Indian languages which came into use during the British rule in India. It was written by Sir Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell and first published in 1886

The term "Hobson Johbson" is shorthand for the assimilation of foreign words to the sound pattern of the adopting language. A number of words have been assimilated into English from Indian languages over the course of colonial rule. Hobson Jobson itself is a corruption of a cry X - then converted to Hosseen Gosseen, Hossy Gossy, Hossein Jossen and, ultimately, Hobson-Jobson

One term that does not fit this pattern in Q: Swami Vigyananand of the Vishva Hindu Parishad caused a bit of controversy when he claimed at a conference that the word Q has its roots in the river Indus. When the British came to India and saw how advanced it was, he said, they coined the word Q.
