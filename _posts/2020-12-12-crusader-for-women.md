X was a major crusader against casteism and for women's rights and education. X preached a practical philosophy including simple marriages that didn't require large amounts of expenditure, and whereby marriages were conducted without being officiated by a Brahmin priest. This encouraged inter-caste marriages, replacing arranged marriages by love marriages that are not constrained by caste.

X rallied strongly for women's rights -- including birth control for women, women's education and doing away with child marriages -- and for the eradication of the caste system. He joined the Indian National Congress in 1919, but resigned in 1925 when he felt that the party was only serving the interests of the Brahmins. In 1944 he formed an organization called Y. An offshoot of Y named Z was started 5 years later by W. Z was the first party in India other than the Indian National Congress to win state-level elections with a clear majority on its own in any state in the country.
