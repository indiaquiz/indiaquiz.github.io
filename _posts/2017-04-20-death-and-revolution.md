The event E1 led to the deaths of 10 million people. About 200 years later, another event E2 of the same type and in the same area led to a further 1.5 million deaths. E1 led, via a chain of events, to a different type of event E3 far away, which precipitated the X Revolution, eventually leading to X's independence. The causes of E1 and E2 are still debated, but it is generally agreed that both nature and man-made causes were responsible. E1 features in Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, where he argues that all events of this type are completely avoidable. Such events have also been studied in detail by P, who proposed a counterintuitive theory for E2, having experienced it first hand as a child. P now lives in X.

Identify E1, E2, E3, X, and P. Explain the link between E1 and E3.

Answers to the events question: E1 is the great famine of bengal that began in 1769. E2 is the Bengal famine of 1943, where Churchill is alleged to have shown a blind eye. E3 is the Boston tea party incident in the Boston harbor where people boarded British ships and dumped 430 tons of tea into the ocean. P is Amartya Sen and X is USA.

The link between E1 and E3 is this:
In 1770 India and America were under the rule of the British east india company which was struggling financially at the time. So it raised taxes in bengal which worsened the impact of failed monsoons. Productivity fell and pushed EIC further into the red. To attempt to recover EIC lobbied the U.K. parliament to pass the Tea Act which allowed direct shipment of tea to America which would effectively have meant the start of a form of taxation for Americans. The Americans got the news of how EIC behaved indifferently during a famine in bengal and to prevent being dominated by the EIC, a bunch of people decided to disguise themselves as American Indians and dumped 430 tons of tea standing on British ships in the Boston harbor into the sea. The situation escalated quickly from there and by 1776 the US declaration of independence was signed.

Sen's counterintuitive theory was that the 1943 famine was due to an economic boom in the region during which wages of the middle class went up very quickly, they consumed much more, causing prices to go up fast, and the lower classes could no longer afford food. In his work Sen managed to procure food production data and claims that total food production in 1943 was not that low.
