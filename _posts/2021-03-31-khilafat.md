The Khilafat movement (1919-1924) also known as the Indian Muslim movement was a pan-Islamist political protest campaign launched by Muslims of British India, in the years following World War I. Its purpose was to pressure the British government to preserve the authority of the Ottoman Sultan following the breakup of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the war.

In 1920 an alliance was made between Khilafat leaders and the Indian National Congress, the largest political party in India. Congress leader Mohandas Gandhi and the Khilafat leaders promised to work and fight together for the causes of Khilafat and Swaraj. Seeking to increase pressure on the colonial government, the Khilafatists became a major part of the non-cooperation movement â€” a nationwide campaign of mass, peaceful civil disobedience.
