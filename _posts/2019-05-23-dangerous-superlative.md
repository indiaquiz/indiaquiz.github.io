X belongs to a small group of superlatives. made X the final member of a small group to have never experienced

In 1852 the Great Trignometrical Survey revealed that Y wasn’t the greatest, pushing it to 3rd place behind X, and a new name Z was crafted for the new greatest after the person who led that survey. X kills one in five. In Jan 2021, Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje did something that pushed X into enter a select club, the last member of the group to enter it.
