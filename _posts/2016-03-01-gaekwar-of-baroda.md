Answer: The image shows King George V and his wife, vising India - this was specifically shot in Delhi during the 'Delhi Durbar' during which the heads of Indian princely states came to pay their respects to the monarch. 
The Gaekwar of Baroda, Maharajah Sayajirao III, approached the royal couple without his jewellery on, and after a simple bow turned his back to them when leaving (custom required bowing 3 times and backing off without showing ones back to the royal couple). His action was taken as a sign of dissent to British rule and he was subsequently ostracized by the British. Incidentally, he is the person who financed 3 years of graduate studies abroad for B R ambedkar, and he was the first ruler to make primary education compulsory and free in his state.
