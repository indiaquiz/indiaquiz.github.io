X was a preeminent Urdu poet and philosopher who is said to have inspired the idea for the creation of Pakistan through his writings and speeches.

In 1904, at the age of 27, X wrote a poem called Tarana-e-Hindi, set to music in the ghazal style. The words beautifully describe a multi-cultural multi-religious and harmonious society, and proclaimed that our civilization must have something great - to have lasted so long having outlived the Romans, Greeks and Egyptians. However, six years later, X wrote another song in the same meter and rhyme, called the Tarana-e-Milli (Milli = religion) that contrasted with The Tarana-e-Hindi. The new piece proclaimed "Central Asia and Arabia are ours, India is ours. We are Muslims, the whole world is our homeland." By 1930, in his address to the Muslim League annual conference in Allahabad, he supported a separate country in the Muslim majority areas of the subcontinent.

In 1997, the then prime minister I.K. Gujral quoted from a couplet written by X while congratulating Y for a major feat. The choice seemed appropriate, not just because of what the couplet conveyed, but also because X's poetry had also been famously used on a similar occasion in the past, involving a different individual and prime minister.

Today, the Tarana-e-Hindi is better known by a different title, Z.

Identify X, Y and Z.
