title: About India Quiz
---

Greetings! This is a collection of quiz questions focused on India. I enjoy learning about Indian history and culture, and I have found quizzing to be a great way to learn more about the intricacies and sometimes surprising aspects India's past. 

Over time, I found that I had collected a large number of quiz questions in group chats and emails. I decided that it would be good to put them together in one place so others might enjoy them too! I hope these questions (and notes that sometimes accompany the answers) will inspire you to learn more about India too!
