Greetings! This is a collection of quiz questions focused on India. I enjoy learning about Indian history and culture, and I have found quizzing to be a great way to learn more about the intricacies and sometimes surprising aspects India's past. Over time, I collected a large number of quiz questions in notebooks and in emails, and I decided to host them in one place so others might enjoy them too! I hope these questions and notes will inspire you to learn more about the rich culture and history behind modern day India.
